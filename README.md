## Our Vision . . .

The inspiration behind designing Cthulhu's Bedtime Stories was to create an inclusive and interactive story that the user could influence. The protagonist's name, actions, their preferred pronouns, and the consequences of their choices are all up to the user.

## Our Site . . .

**There are four pages that a user visiting our website can visit:**
* the **Splash Page**
* the **Character Creation Page**
* the **Story Page**
* and the **About Us Page**

#### Splash Page

This is the landing page a user will see before they begin their exploration of Cthulhu's Bedtime Stories. It features a Login option (for returning users) and a Character Creation button, which both take the user to their own respective pages. This page also has an About Us link at the bottom.

#### Character Creation Page

Clicking the 'Create Character' button will take the user here where they can create their username and character. To do this they type in a username, a character name, and a gender for their character. The character name and gender they choose will then be incorporated into the story. From here, the user clicks the 'Off to Dreamland' button, which takes them to the...

#### Story Page

This is where the fun begins. On this page the user gets to read the story we've created (which incorporates the character information they chose when creating their character) and choose from two choices. The choices the user makes throughout the pages of the story will dictate the fate of their character on the final page.

#### About Us Page

As the name of the page suggests, this is a page that allows the user to get to know the developers behind Cthulhu's Bedtime Stories.
